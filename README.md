# XKCDatabaseNEO
This project started as a few Python scripts to make a comprehensive, usable SQLite database consolidating information about Randall Munroe's incredible xkcd webcomic. Now, using that SQLite database, I'm developing a Flutter mobile app that will let people view, sort through, and share comics quickly and easily. *XKCDatabaseNEO is a work in progress.*
